# Given an array of intervals intervals, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
# Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders ”touching” but they don’t overlap each other.

# Example 1
# intervals = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3]]
# Output: 1

# Example 2
# intervals = [[1,2], [1,2], [1,2]]
# Output: 2

def remove_intervals(intervals: list) -> int:
  pass
