# A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (){}[].
# Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket occurs to the left of a closing bracket of the exact same type.
# There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
# Given a string, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return True. Otherwise, return False.

# Example 1
# Input: s = '{[()]}'
# Output: True

# Example 2
# Input: s = '{[(])}'
# Output: False

def is_balanced(s: str) -> bool:
