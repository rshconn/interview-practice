# Given a matrix of n x n size, find the saddle point of the matrix. 
# A saddle point is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and the maximum in its column. 

# Example 1
# Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Output: 7

# Example 2
# Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 18, 4]]
# Output: None
